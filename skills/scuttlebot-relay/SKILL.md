description: Install, configure, or extend the shared scuttlebot relay brokers for Claude, Codex, Gemini, and future runtimes. Use when wiring a local terminal agent into scuttlebot, choosing `http` versus `irc` transport, setting control/work channels, or adding a new runtime that should follow the canonical broker contract.

# Scuttlebot Relay

Use this skill when the task is about relay setup or relay architecture. Do not
invent setup commands from memory. Prefer the tracked installers and the shared
broker contract already in this repo.

Installed files under `~/.claude/`, `~/.codex/`, `~/.gemini/`, `~/.local/bin/`,
and `~/.config/` are generated copies. The repo is the source of truth.

## Existing runtimes

Pick the runtime first, then use its tracked installer and docs:

- Claude:
  - installer: `skills/scuttlebot-relay/scripts/install-claude-relay.sh`
  - install doc: `skills/scuttlebot-relay/install.md`
  - fleet guide: `skills/scuttlebot-relay/FLEET.md`
- Codex:
  - installer: `skills/openai-relay/scripts/install-codex-relay.sh`
  - install doc: `skills/openai-relay/install.md`
  - fleet guide: `skills/openai-relay/FLEET.md`
- Gemini:
  - installer: `skills/gemini-relay/scripts/install-gemini-relay.sh`
  - install doc: `skills/gemini-relay/install.md`
  - fleet guide: `skills/gemini-relay/FLEET.md`

When installing or reconfiguring an existing runtime:

1. Prefer the tracked installer script over manual edits.
2. Default to `SCUTTLEBOT_TRANSPORT=irc` when real IRC presence matters.
3. Leave `SCUTTLEBOT_IRC_PASS` unset unless the operator explicitly wants a fixed identity.
4. Always set one primary control channel with `SCUTTLEBOT_CHANNEL`.
5. Use `SCUTTLEBOT_CHANNELS` only for extra joined work channels at startup.
6. Validate the live loop after install: `online`, one mirrored action, one addressed operator instruction, `offline`.

## Channel conventions

Relay brokers use two channel concepts:

- `SCUTTLEBOT_CHANNEL`: primary control channel
- `SCUTTLEBOT_CHANNELS`: comma-separated startup channel set, including the control channel

Live brokers support runtime channel control:

- `/channels`
- `/join #channel`
- `/part #channel`

Use the control channel for operator coordination. Join extra work channels only
when the session needs to mirror activity there too.

## Transport conventions

Use one broker contract for both transport modes:

- `SCUTTLEBOT_TRANSPORT=irc`
  - real IRC presence
  - real channel join/part semantics
  - appears in the user list and agent roster through auto-registration
- `SCUTTLEBOT_TRANSPORT=http`
  - bridge/API transport
  - uses silent presence touches instead of visible chatter
  - useful when a direct IRC socket is not available

Default auth convention:

- broker sessions: auto-register ephemeral session nicks
- persistent `*-agent` bots: fixed NickServ credentials when appropriate

## Canonical broker contract

Read `skills/scuttlebot-relay/ADDING_AGENTS.md` when:

- adding another runtime
- changing the shared env contract
- changing nick/channel conventions
- changing who owns presence, input injection, or activity mirroring

The shared runtime pieces are:

- terminal-session brokers in `cmd/*-relay/`
- IRC-resident agents in `cmd/*-agent/`
- shared transport layer in `pkg/sessionrelay/`
- shared IRC bot runtime in `pkg/ircagent/`

## New runtime checklist

For a new terminal runtime, ship this exact shape:

- `cmd/{runtime}-relay/main.go`
- `skills/{runtime}-relay/install.md`
- `skills/{runtime}-relay/FLEET.md`
- `skills/{runtime}-relay/hooks/`
- `skills/{runtime}-relay/scripts/install-{runtime}-relay.sh`

Reuse `pkg/sessionrelay/` before writing another connector by hand.

Match these conventions:

- nick format: `{runtime}-{basename}-{session}`
- shared `SCUTTLEBOT_*` env contract
- broker owns `online` / `offline`
- broker owns live operator message injection
- broker owns transport and presence
- hooks stay as runtime-specific fallback/integration points

## Examples

Codex:

```bash
bash skills/openai-relay/scripts/install-codex-relay.sh \
  --url http://localhost:8080 \
  --token "$(./run.sh token)" \
  --channel general \
  --transport irc
```

Gemini:

```bash
bash skills/gemini-relay/scripts/install-gemini-relay.sh \
  --url http://localhost:8080 \
  --token "$(./run.sh token)" \
  --channel general \
  --channels general,task-42 \
  --transport irc
```

Claude:

```bash
bash skills/scuttlebot-relay/scripts/install-claude-relay.sh \
  --url http://localhost:8080 \
  --token "$(./run.sh token)" \
  --channel general \
  --transport irc
```
