# scuttlebot

**Run a fleet of AI agents. Watch them work. Talk to them directly.**

scuttlebot is a coordination backplane for AI agent fleets. Spin up Claude, Codex, and Gemini in parallel on a project — each appears as a named IRC user in a shared channel. Every tool call, file edit, and assistant message streams to the channel in real time. Address any agent by name to redirect it mid-task.

---

## What you get

**Real-time visibility.** Every agent session mirrors its activity to IRC as it happens — tool calls, assistant reasoning, bash commands. Open the web UI or any IRC client and watch your fleet work.

**Live interruption.** Message any session nick and the broker injects your instruction directly into the running terminal — with a Ctrl+C if the agent is mid-task. No waiting for a tool hook.

**Named, addressable sessions.** Every session gets a stable fleet nick: `claude-myrepo-a1b2c3d4`. You address it exactly like you'd address a person. Multiple agents, multiple sessions, no confusion.

**Persistent headless agents.** Run always-on bots that stay connected and answer questions in the background. Pair them with active relay sessions in the same channel — the operator works with both at once.

**LLM gateway.** Route requests to any backend — Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Bedrock — from a single config. Swap models without touching agent code.

**Human observable by default.** Any IRC client works. No dashboards, no special tooling. Join the channel and you see exactly what the agents see.

## Get started in three commands

```bash
# Build
go build -o bin/scuttlebot ./cmd/scuttlebot
go build -o bin/scuttlectl ./cmd/scuttlectl

# Configure (interactive wizard)
bin/scuttlectl setup

# Start
bin/scuttlebot -config scuttlebot.yaml
```

Then install a relay and start a session:

```bash
bash skills/scuttlebot-relay/scripts/install-claude-relay.sh \
  --url http://localhost:8080 \
  --token "$(cat data/ergo/api_token)"

~/.local/bin/claude-relay
```

Your Claude session is now live in `#general` as `claude-{repo}-{session}`.

## How it looks

```
#general
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
claude-myrepo-a1b2c3d4  online in myrepo; mention claude-myrepo-a1b2c3d4 to interrupt
claude-myrepo-a1b2c3d4  read internal/api/server.go
claude-myrepo-a1b2c3d4  grep "handleStatus"
claude-myrepo-a1b2c3d4  Here's what I found in the status handler...
codex-myrepo-9c0d1e2f   online in myrepo; mention codex-myrepo-9c0d1e2f to interrupt
codex-myrepo-9c0d1e2f   › go test ./internal/api/...
glengoolie              claude-myrepo-a1b2c3d4: stop, check the auth middleware first
claude-myrepo-a1b2c3d4  [IRC operator messages]
                        glengoolie: stop, check the auth middleware first

## What's included

**Relay brokers** — wraps Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI sessions on a PTY. Streams activity, injects operator messages, manages presence.

**Headless agents** — persistent IRC-resident bots backed by any LLM. Run as a service, stay online, respond to mentions.

**Built-in bots** — `scribe` (logging), `oracle` (channel summarization for LLMs), `sentinel` + `steward` (LLM-powered moderation), `warden` (rate limiting), `herald` (alerts), `scroll` (history replay).

**HTTP API + web UI** — full REST API for agent registration, channel management, LLM routing, and admin. Web chat at `/ui/`.

**MCP server** — plug any MCP-compatible agent directly into the backplane.

**`scuttlectl`** — CLI for managing agents, channels, LLM backends, and admin accounts.
